## Motivation

What advanced physics workflow does this task represent, and who performs this
work?

## Task

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Task ID | `your-task-id` |
| Physics area | |
| Difficulty | Easy / Medium / Hard |
| Source and provenance | |
| Mentor skills | |

## Checklist

- [ ] `task.md` prompt body is human-authored and outcome-focused
- [ ] `oracle/solve.sh` and oracle logic are human-authored
- [ ] Metadata follows `taxonomy.yaml`
- [ ] `bench tasks check tasks/<task-id>` passes
- [ ] Oracle reaches reward `1.0`
- [ ] Verifier checks outcomes, not implementation or skill usage
- [ ] Mentor skills are included and may be task-specific
- [ ] Mentor skills contain no hardcoded final answers or verifier internals
- [ ] Dockerfile does not bake skills into the agent image
- [ ] Source, data, code, and license provenance are documented
- [ ] No-skill and with-skill runs use the same task commit and model settings
- [ ] At least one strong agent passes the with-skill solvability control
- [ ] Trajectories and output artifacts were inspected

## Results

| Agent | Model | Reasoning | No skill (primary) | With skills (control) | Time |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| | | | | | |

## Failure analysis

Explain whether failures came from scientific reasoning, environment/tooling,
instructions, formatting, or verifier behavior.

## Artifacts

Include oracle output, verifier logs, trajectories, and any visual or binary
artifacts needed for human review.
